This repo is for putting random things in.

You can push to it from your own repos without building off of the master branch, or anything else in it really. For example:

git add random git@git.evergreen-ils.org:working/random
git push random local_branch:user/yourusername/local_branch

Otherwise it follows the rules of working repos.
